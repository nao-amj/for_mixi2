Create an ultra-high resolution anime-style depiction of a beautiful girl with a gentle smile set in the bustling nightscape of Shibuya. Her hair is a vibrant black, styled intricately, with strands catching the neon light. Her eyes are a striking red, reflecting the city's energy. The composition is dynamic, capturing the chaos and vibrancy of Shibuya with a high-fidelity approach. Ensure there are intricate details in her facial expressions, hair, and the surrounding environment. Use a vivid, high-contrast color palette to make her stand out, with dynamic angles, motion blur, and speed lines to convey movement. The lighting should highlight her features while integrating with the neon-lit city background, showing reflections in her eyes and hair.

公式ドキュメントに記載の相互フォローを前提としないXの思想は目から鱗だった。基本的に自分のしたい活用方法を優先するけど、公式の思想にも触れたい派。

Grok-2のコード生成精度を少し検証した。
プロンプト依存、言語依存あるとしても、個人的にClaude 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4oよりも好きな何かがある。(o1は除外)

The source code of a program created with AI and an English text—there’s something they have in common. AI assists, but my basic skills and judgment still come into play. In other words, AI generates something that looks right, something that sounds right. Anyone can do that part. But is it really okay like that? What about the quality? Any mistakes? To be sure, you need a base level of human skills. The same goes for image-gen AI. That’s why I work on improving my pencil drawing skills and understanding of painting. And I make sure to have fun with it😊

When posting in a community, if the “Also thare with followers” option is checked, trying to hide it from the feed later results in an error. I thought it might work after some time, but the error remains. So, I end up having to delete the original post. I’m just trying to hide it from the feed, so why does this happen?

Considering that deleting the linked community post removes it, maybe when a post is shared to the feed, the original post’s ID can’t be referenced from the shared post. This could cause the hide operation to fail despite the relationship being there. Or it could simply be an issue with the set time limit for errors when trying to hide the post.

I don’t really know what’s actually happening, but I just wanted to leave a record that I thought about it🧐
